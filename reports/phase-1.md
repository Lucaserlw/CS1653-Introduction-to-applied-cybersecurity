## Section 1: Selected Application
The secure group-based resource-sharing application that our team is developing will be a encrypted messaging system. Our application will allow users to send encrypted messages and engage in groups while protecting the security and integrity of their messages. The system's user capacity has no hard-coded limit and is dynamically increased and decreased which implies that the application can expand its user base without any problems. Users can be added to and deleted from groups and communication channels with dynamic membership.  Users can join various groups and communication channels based on their interests or organizational requirements thanks to this flexibility. Additionally, in order to access the system, users of our application must first authenticate themselves with the authentication server. Users will also be able to complete many tasks with a single authentication in order to improve usability. With that being said, we intend to build a strong and intuitive messaging system that prioritizes security, scalability, and effective resource sharing among user groups by integrating these features and capabilities into our secure group-based resource-sharing program. Below is a diagram outlining the components of our application:

## Section 2: Security Properties
* **Confidentiality**
<br>Confidentiality ensures that the content of messages and shared resources remains protected and only accessible to authorized users. It involves encrypting the messages and data to prevent unauthorized access or interception. It is important to maintain the privacy of conversations and shared information. It prevents unauthorized users or attackers from gaining access to sensitive data, ensuring that only intended recipients can read the messages and access shared resources.
* **Authentication**
<br>Authorization determines users access to perform specific operations within their respective groups based on their specific permissions and roles. This is crucial because it guards against unauthorized activities and protects the system's resources and functionality against abuse or prohibited modifications. This would ultimately assume that the access control policies are correctly implemented and kept up to date and that the authorization mechanism accurately enforces the designated roles and permissions.
* **Message Integrity**
<br>Message integrity ensures that the content of messages remains intact and unaltered during transmission and storage. It is important to prevent tampering or modification of messages by unauthorized parties. It ensures that the messages received by the recipients are the same as the ones sent by the senders, without any unauthorized alterations. This property assumes that the system implements mechanisms to verify the integrity of messages, such as using digital signatures or message authentication codes. 
* **Secure Key Management**
<br>Secure Key Management is the process of safely creating, distributing, storing and revoking the encryption keys that are used to encrypt and decrypt messages. This is necessary to protect the confidentiality and integrity of user communications and prevent unauthorized access to encrypted information. This property assumes that the key management system generates, stores, and distributes encryption keys using reliable cryptographic algorithms and secure procedures.
* **Secure Group Membership Management**
<br>Secure Group Management validates secure addition and removal of users from groups while maintaining the confidentiality of group membership information. This property is essential because it protects group members' privacy and guarantees that only authorized individuals can access the group's resources. This property makes the assumption that group membership activities are carried out securely and that when changing group membership, the system verifies users' authorization and authentication.
* **Secure Channel Encryption**
<br>Secure channel encryption ensures that the communication channels between users and the system are encrypted, protecting the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data. Secure channel encryption is essential to prevent eavesdropping or interception of sensitive information during transit. It ensures that the communication between users and the system remains secure, even if the network is compromised. This property assumes that the system implements secure protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), to encrypt the communication channels.
* **User Privacy**
<br>User privacy ensures that the personal information and activities of users are protected from unauthorized access or disclosure. User privacy is crucial for building trust in the system. It safeguards the personal data of users, such as their profile information, conversation history, or group affiliations, from unauthorized access or misuse. This property assumes that the system implements privacy measures, such as data anonymization, consent management, or data protection regulations to protect user privacy. 
* **Secure Storage**
<br>Secure storage ensures that the messages and shared resources are stored securely, protecting them from unauthorized access or data breaches. Secure storage prevents unauthorized individuals or attackers from gaining access to stored messages or shared resources. It ensures that the data at rest remains protected and cannot be easily compromised. This property assumes that the system employs strong encryption techniques to protect the stored data. 
* **Input Validation**
Input validation involves validating and sanitizing user inputs to prevent malicious input or unexpected data from compromising the system's security. This property is important because it mitigates the risk of injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting), buffer overflows, and other input-related vulnerabilities. This property assumes the implementation of input validation mechanisms, such as input sanitization, parameterized queries, or input length and format checks, to ensure the integrity and security of data processing.
* **Availability**
Availability ensures that the system and its resources are accessible and usable by authorized users whenever needed. This property is important because it minimizes downtime, ensures continuous service delivery, and prevents disruption of critical operations. This property depends on robust infrastructure, redundancy measures, fault tolerance, and effective disaster recovery plans to mitigate service disruptions or failures.
* **Session Management**
Session management ensures the secure initiation, maintenance, and termination of user sessions, preventing unauthorized access to active sessions. Session management is important to control and monitor user access to the system. It prevents unauthorized individuals from hijacking active sessions or gaining access to user accounts. This property assumes that the system implements secure session handling techniques, such as session tokens, session timeouts, and session termination upon logout or inactivity.
* **Incident Response and Recovery**
Incident response and recovery involve having a well-defined plan and procedures in place to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents or breaches. Incident response and recovery capabilities are essential to minimize the impact of security incidents and restore the system's security and functionality. They enable the timely identification, containment, investigation, and resolution of security issues. This property assumes that the system has a dedicated incident response team or process, along with established procedures for handling security incidents. 
* **Secure User Account Management**
Secure user account management ensures that user accounts are created, managed, and accessed securely, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or account compromise. It is crucial to protect user identities and prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access to user accounts. It involves implementing strong password policies, enabling multi-factor authentication, and providing secure mechanisms for account recovery and password resets. This property assumes that the system enforces strong password policies, such as minimum password length and complexity requirements.
* **Secure Error Handling and Reporting**
Secure error handling and reporting ensure that errors and exceptions occurring within the application are handled securely and do not expose sensitive information or provide potential attack vectors. Secure error handling and reporting help maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the system by preventing the leakage of sensitive information that could aid attackers in exploiting vulnerabilities. It involves providing informative but non-disclosing error messages and logging errors securely. This property assumes that the application handles errors gracefully, without revealing sensitive system or user information in error messages.
* **Integrity of Identity**
Integrity of Identity ensures that a user's identity can be trusted in conversations between a user and server or a user and another user. In other words, untrustworthy nodes in a system cannot pretend to be nodes that they are not. This is fundamental to the security of a messaging system as messages would carry no weight or potentially spread misinformation if we were unable to verify the identity of the person on the other side of a message. In our model, this assumes that the authentication server can administer tokens securely such that no untrustworthy individual or system has access to a user's authentication token for another channel or system.
* **Self-Authored Modification**
Self-Authored Modification ensures that the user who wrote a message is also the one who modifies it. This is important because a message's meaning could be discretely changed if a system allowed users with write permissions in a messaging system to edit other users' messages. While this wouldn't be necessary in a filesystem, it creates trust in any messaging system that emphasizes the messages of individuals.
## Section 3: Threat Models
* **Business Network Secure Messaging Channels**
<br>In a business environment, the secure messaging system $S$ would be deployed over a local area network with nodes $N$ by an organization $O \subset N$. A set of system administrators $A \in O$ would be responsible for configuring system $S$, adding and removing networked users from $S$, and adding and removing users in $S$ from messaging channels in $S$. The system administrators would register and configure host servers to ensure they functioned properly. All users in $S$ could read messages in channels they have read access in, write messages in channels they have write access in, and modify self-authored messages in channels they have write access in.
<br>In this environment, the authentication server would be trusted to ensure that for $\forall n \in N, n \in S \iff n \in O$. In other words, a node in the network is in the messaging system if and only if the node is a member of the organization. It would also be trusted to provide authentication tokens, ensuring that $n \not O$ would not be given an authentication and authorization token. The authentication server would also be trusted to provide the host servers with the correct authentication and authorization token for each $n \in S$ at any given time. The host servers would be trusted to use these tokens to ensure that only those with adequate permissions can read from, write to, and modify the communication channels hosted on those servers.
<br>**Important Security Properties**:
    * **Confidentiality**: Network users outside of the organization should not be allowed access to messages inside the organization's channels. Members of the organization should not access messages in channels they are not a part of.
    * **Authentication**: Authentication prevents unauthorized users from accessing resources and ensures no users are being impersonated.
    * **Message Integrity**: This system should enable consistent long-term communication throughout the organization. The integity of message storage an transmission is essential to this goal.
    * **Secure Channel Encryption**: This is important to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks on the network that target either the communication between the host servers and the users or the users and the authentication servers.
    * **Secure Storage**: Storing messages securely is just as important as secure transmission to prevent messages from being read by infiltration of the servers.
    * **Availability**: The messaging system needs to be available to its users at almost any time to maintain the organization's workflow and ensure that the system is not infiltrated while it is left unavailable.
    * **Secure User Account Management**: The messaging system needs secure user account management to ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot access important channels or communications within the organization.
    * **Self-Authored Modification**: In the case where there is a breach of communications, ensuring that only the author of a message can modify is an important step in mitigating damage.

* **Distributed Secure Messaging Service**
<br>In a distributed environment, host servers are managed by individuals or organizations who are not affiliated with the authentication server. In this case, the authentication server provides the host servers with authentication and authorization tokens validating users' identities in the distributed network. Only host servers a user has access to will be provided with an authentication token from the server. In this environment, there is also no guarantee that a user is affiliated with any given host server or its communication channels.
<br>In this environment, we assume that host servers are untrustworthy. We assume that a host server will use a provided user token to try to gain access to another server if able. We can trust the host server to provide the authentication server with information regarding who it would allow access, but we cannot assume that a user wants access to any given channel of communication, even if given the opportunity. As a result, the authentication server must not trust the host server to provide accurate information regarding who has accepted access to its communication channels. There must be a form of mutual agreement between the user and a host server that user has access to a given host server's communication channel. Given the prescence of a singular authentication server, users and host servers are forced to place trust in the authentication server. While the authentication server would be able to imitate any user given that it controls the creation and administering of tokens, this is a flaw in the system that is relatively unavoidable.
<br>**Important Security Properties**:
    * **Authorization**: In this distributed system, the authorization at the core of everything is what binds the host servers together in a sense and allows the servers to be part of a larger network rather than a set of individual communication channels.
    * **Secure Group Membership Management**: In a distributed system where host servers are untrustworthy, it's important that host servers cannot see a user's membership in foreign communication channels to protect the users' privacy and prevent targeted attacks or spam.
    * **User Privacy**: In a similar nature to the former, it's important that malicious host servers cannot learn all there is to know about all of the users in the system or even all of the users in the host server.
    * **Session Management**: In the distributed system, it's important that user tokens and sessions are properly evaluated to minimize the chances of a user's token being hijacked and used to gain access to that user's channels and servers.
    * **Input Validation**: Given that users in a distributed system are untrustworthy, it's important that we validate their messages and modifications to prevent users from running malicious code on any of our servers or client applications.
    * **Secure Error Handling and Reporting**: Given that host servers are reliant upon our authentication server for user authentication and authorization, it's important that we practice proper and secure error reporting to minimize risks to host servers.
    * **Integrity of Identity**: It's very important in this system that authentication tokens are a trustworthy means for portraying user identity. Since we cannot trust our host servers, it's important that each host server for which a user has membership recieves a different authentication token. This prevents host servers from impersonating users.
